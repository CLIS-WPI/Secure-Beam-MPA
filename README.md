Secure-Beam-MPA: Proactive mmWave Security Secure Beamforming in mmWave Networks: A Multimodal Predictive Approach with Strategic AlignmentThis project introduces a cutting-edge framework for enhancing security and efficiency in millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless networks. It moves beyond traditional reactive defenses by employing a proactive and predictive strategy. The core of the system is a multimodal deep learning model that processes both Channel State Information (CSI) and Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC)-derived threat intelligence. This allows it to simultaneously predict user location and select the optimal communication beam.A significant innovation is the use of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to strategically align the beamforming model's decisions with crucial operational policies, such as prioritizing security (e.g., avoiding beams directed towards potential attackers) and maintaining link stability alongside performance. The simulation is developed in Python, leveraging TensorFlow for deep learning and the Sionna library for realistic link-level simulations, including its 3GPP TR 38.901 channel models and MIMO functionalities.Key FeaturesüöÄ Predictive Dual-Task Model: Simultaneously forecasts user location and selects the optimal beam.üîó Multimodal Data Fusion: Integrates CSI with ISAC-based threat intelligence for robust, context-aware decisions.üõ°Ô∏è Strategic Alignment with DPO: Fine-tunes the model using Direct Preference Optimization to ensure decisions prioritize security and link stability.üì° Sionna-based Simulation: Employs Sionna for accurate mmWave channel modeling and advanced beamforming techniques (DFT-based beam codebooks).‚öôÔ∏è End-to-End Workflow: Provides a complete pipeline from data generation and model training (pre-training & DPO alignment) to comprehensive evaluation.PrerequisitesEnsure you have the following installed:Python 3.8+TensorFlow 2.10+Sionna 0.15+ (Official Installation Guide)NumPyPandastqdmYou can install most Python packages using pip:pip install tensorflow numpy pandas tqdm

(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username if you host it there.)Save the Script:Ensure the main Python script (e.g., main_predictive_v2.py) is in your working directory.How to RunThe simulation script (<your_script_name>.py, e.g., main_predictive_v2.py) operates in three distinct modes. Execute them in the following order:Generate Training Data:This command simulates the mmWave environment to create a dataset for training the predictive model.python <your_script_name>.py --mode generate-data --num_samples 20000
--num_samples (optional, default: 20000): Number of data samples to generate.Output: Creates training_data.npz.Train the Model (Pre-training + DPO Alignment):This command trains the model in two phases: initial supervised pre-training and then DPO fine-tuning for strategic alignment.python <your_script_name>.py --mode train --epochs 20 --dpo_epochs 5
--epochs (optional, default: 20): Epochs for pre-training.--dpo_epochs (optional, default: 5): Epochs for DPO fine-tuning.Outputs: Creates pretrained_model.weights.h5 and the final aligned_model.weights.h5.Evaluate the Final Aligned Model:This command loads the strategically aligned model and assesses its performance on new, unseen scenarios.python <your_script_name>.py --mode evaluate
Output: Creates evaluation_results_predictive_v2.csv.Expected OutputsLog File: predictive_beamforming_v2.log (contains detailed logs from the simulation).Generated Data: training_data.npz.Model Weights:pretrained_model.weights.h5aligned_model.weights.h5 (the final, deployable model).Evaluation Results: evaluation_results_predictive_v2.csv (includes metrics like beam prediction accuracy and strategic safety rate).ContributingContributions are welcome!
